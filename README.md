## Synopsis
This repository contains a single python file with a set of functions to perform structural mechanics calculations.
All the necessary data is contained within the program either in lists or variables.
## Motivation
This program was made in order to meet the requirements of a structural mechanics laboratory - certain graphs and results
needed to be produced. Saving this to GIT saves me having to email it from my desktop to my university account constantly.
